## Preparing a Pull Request

Before working on a large change, please open an issue first to discuss it with maintainers. A good PR is small, focused, and clearly communicates the problem it solves.

1. Fork and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/vapor-ui.git
cd vapor-ui
git remote add upstream https://github.com/goorm-dev/vapor-ui.git
```

2. Ensure your Node version matches the [.nvmrc](../.nvmrc):

```bash
node -v
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

Now you can view components at `http://localhost:9009`.

## Development Setup

1. Create a new branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b fix/button-loading-state
```

2. Make your changes and test them in Storybook

3. Write tests for your changes and Run the test suite:

```bash
pnpm test
```

4. Add a changeset if your changes affect users:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

5. Commit your changes using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git commit -m "fix(Button): correct loading state styling"
```
